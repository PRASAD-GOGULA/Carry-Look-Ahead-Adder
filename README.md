# Carry-Look-Ahead-Adder
In my Verilog project, I replaced a ripple carry adder with a carry look-ahead adder to reduce propagation delay. Ripple carry adders suffer from linear delay due to sequential carry propagation. I implemented generate and propagate logic to compute carries in parallel, first designing a 4-bit CLA and then scaling it hierarchically. After synthesis, I observed a significant improvement in timing performance at the cost of slightly increased area. This improved the ALU’s critical path and overall speed.
